The applications of logics in computer science range over diverse fields and concepts. Some examples are artificial intelligence \cite{hu2016neuralNetworks}, concurrency \cite{caires2003spatial}, parallel systems \cite{iliano2012ccsll} and semantics of programming languages \cite{ellison2012executable}. This variety of applications is not incidental; the very nature of logic as a means of modeling how consequences follow from a set of premises is akin to that of computation.

A particular logic which was specifically created with computational goals in mind is Dynamic Logic (DL).
In its original version, DL is a modal logic containing modalities.
